# Contributing

Any contribution is most welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests,
explaining what change you made & why.

## Development Environment

To get set up:

  * `npm install` to install development dependencies.
  * `npm run example` will run the example on `localhost:3000` and recompile
    files whenever you make a change.

This last solution is useful for development. You can open your browser at
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), play with the example and see your
changes along the way.

Sources are `lower-case-dashed.js` or `styl`, 4-space indented and try to wrap
at 80 columns.
